# Chemistry 308: Topics in Physical Chemistry

This is an upper level chemistry class that extends students' previous experience with quantum chemistry. There is an emphasis on linear algebra--operators are represented by matrices, quantum states by vectors--and numerical methods.

For more information on representing quantum states as vectors, see [Vectors and Quantum States](/Vectors-and-Quantum-States.md).
